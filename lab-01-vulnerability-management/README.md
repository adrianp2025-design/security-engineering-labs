# Lab 01: Vulnerability Management – Linux

## Objective
Identify, analyze, and remediate common vulnerabilities on a Linux system using basic security tools and system updates.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu Linux (local VM or cloud instance)
- User: Non-root with sudo access
- Network: Isolated test environment

## Tools Used
- apt
- system logs
- manual configuration review

## Steps Performed
1. Updated system packages
2. Identified outdated or vulnerable packages
3. Reviewed system services
4. Applied security updates
5. Verified remediation

## Key Commands
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service

## Findings
- Outdated packages increase attack surface
- Unnecessary services should be disabled
- Regular patching reduces known vulnerabilities

## Outcome
System brought to a secure baseline through patching and service review.

## Lessons Learned
Vulnerability management is continuous and requires visibility, prioritization, and verification.
