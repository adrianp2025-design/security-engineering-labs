Hands-on security engineering labs covering vulnerability management, logging, and compliance fundamentals
This repository contains hands-on security engineering labs focused on vulnerability management, logging and monitoring, system hardening, and compliance-aligned security controls.

All labs are designed for learning and demonstration purposes using non-production systems and sanitized data.

## Lab Objectives
- Understand vulnerability identification and remediation
- Implement baseline system hardening
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Apply security controls aligned with RMF concepts
- Build documentation suitable for audits and reviews

## Lab Environment
- Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu), Windows
- Tools: Open-source security tools
- Cloud: AWS (limited use where applicable)
- Approach: Manual configuration + documentation

## Labs
1. Vulnerability Management Basics (Linux)
2. System Hardening & Baseline Controls
3. Logging and Monitoring Fundamentals
4. Security Control Documentation (RMF-aligned)

## Disclaimer
All configurations use test systems, sample data, and non-sensitive values.
